  "summary": "The diff addresses REQ-1 by fixing TypeScript/runtime errors in Admin.tsx, DepartmentManager.tsx, and useQueries.ts. DepartmentManager.tsx was refactored with a typed DepartmentRoute literal type and extracted DepartmentCard component to fix TanStack Router Link type errors. useQueries.ts now imports AgentStatus enum and uses it correctly. Admin.tsx now includes a fifth Departments tab rendering DepartmentManager. The backend schema is unchanged. No constrained files were modified.",
