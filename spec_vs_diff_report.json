  "summary": "All five requirements are implemented in the diff. The backend Weapon type and CRUD functions are added to backend/main.mo, React Query hooks are added to useQueries.ts, a public Weapons page is created, routing and navigation links are added, and a WeaponManager admin component plus Admin panel tab are implemented. One minor discrepancy: the spec calls the field 'type' but the implementation uses 'weaponType' — this is a consistent rename across all files and functionally equivalent. No missing requirements were found.",
